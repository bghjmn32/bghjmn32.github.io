## Generative Text Summary
Generative text summaries are characterized by the fact that they do not use sentences that already exist in the original text. Rather, it generates a summary of the text by some means of understanding the "main idea" of the text.

## Coding
In the past week, we have been trying the open source code on the web, but we are currently creating a training data set because of the lack of training material.

## Other
The last week I have been delayed by a lot of chores that I have to deal with. My residence has not yet been approved, so I had to go to the immigration office to make inquiries; my housing contract expired and could not be renewed, and I went to look at houses all over Stockholm (the prices in the city are crazy and most landlords do not want to rent to people without residence :( ); I managed to get an appointment for my vaccination, which makes it possible for me to finish the second shot in September and have the chance to return to my country :(

Need to work a little more this week


## 欧洲杯
